UNITY PACKAGE
They are 3 folders containing 3 seperate models each with 3 respectively:
 	1. 	BASE_MODEL: Base model that can transition between male and female with additional body modifications.
		This version of INHYEONG 2.0 encourages user customization. There are more animations not used in the
		final publish of the model such as CHESTSIZE_M parameter. I would love to see what edits you make to 
		the INHYEONG 2.0! Please @ my twitter @HyeonHyunHyoon with #INHYEONG so I can see them!
	
	2. 	TACTICALV1: one of two Tactical alternatives to the INHYEONG 2.0. This version can transition between
		male and female with included toggles for clothes and GFE rifle.

	3. 	TACTICALV2: one of two Tactical alternatives to the INHYEONG 2.0. This version is female only due to asset
		edits on the mesh. This version can toggle kunai, GFE rifle, and rifle appearance.
